# N8N Deployment Summary

## Deployment Status: ✅ SUCCESSFUL (IMPROVED)

Your n8n workspace has been successfully deployed to your AKS cluster with comprehensive improvements based on production best practices!

## Current Status

### ✅ Infrastructure Components
- **Namespace**: `n8n-prod` - Created and active
- **Service Account**: `n8n` - Created with RBAC permissions
- **Storage**: 20Gi Premium SSD PVC - Bound and ready
- **Secrets**: `n8n-secrets` - Created with encryption key

### ✅ Application Components
- **n8n Pod**: Running and healthy (1/1 Ready)
- **Service**: ClusterIP service exposed on port 5678
- **Ingress**: Configured for external access with TLS
- **Network Policy**: Applied for security (improved with proper ingress rules)
- **Backup CronJob**: Enhanced with proper error handling and Azure managed identity
- **Backup Service Account**: Created with appropriate RBAC permissions

### ✅ Health Checks
- **Pod Status**: Running
- **Health Endpoint**: Responding correctly (`{"status":"ok"}`)
- **Database**: Migrations completed successfully
- **Storage**: PVC bound and mounted

## Resource Allocation

Due to cluster policy constraints, n8n is running with reduced resources:
- **CPU Requests**: 100m (0.1 cores)
- **CPU Limits**: 200m (0.2 cores)
- **Memory Requests**: 256Mi
- **Memory Limits**: 1Gi
- **Storage**: 20Gi Premium SSD

## Access Information

### Internal Access
- **Service**: `n8n.n8n-prod.svc.cluster.local:5678`
- **Health Check**: `http://localhost:5678/healthz`

### External Access (Pending Configuration)
- **Domain**: `n8n.yourdomain.com` (needs to be updated)
- **Protocol**: HTTPS with automatic SSL certificate
- **Ingress**: NGINX with TLS termination

## Next Steps Required

### 1. Domain Configuration
Update the domain name in the following files:
- `k8s/deployment/n8n-deployment.yaml` - Update `N8N_HOST` and `WEBHOOK_URL`
- `k8s/deployment/n8n-ingress.yaml` - Update hostname

### 2. Azure Managed Identity Setup
Configure Azure managed identity for backup operations:
- Update `k8s/rbac/backup-service-account.yaml` with your managed identity details
- Grant Storage Blob Data Contributor role to the managed identity

### 2. DNS Configuration
Point your domain to the ingress controller's external IP:
```bash
# Get the ingress external IP
kubectl get svc -n ingress-nginx
```

### 3. Security Updates
- Update the encryption key in `k8s/secrets/n8n-secrets.yaml`
- Review and update any additional secrets

### 4. Azure Storage Configuration
Update the backup CronJob with your Azure Storage account:
- `k8s/backup/backup-cronjob.yaml` - Update `AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT` environment variable
- Create `n8n-backups` container in your Azure Storage account

### 5. SQL Server Integration
If connecting to SQL Server, add the connection details to the deployment:
- Update environment variables in `k8s/deployment/n8n-deployment.yaml`
- Test connectivity from the pod

## Monitoring Commands

### Check Pod Status
```bash
kubectl get pods -n n8n-prod
```

### View Logs
```bash
kubectl logs -n n8n-prod deployment/n8n -f
```

### Check Services
```bash
kubectl get svc -n n8n-prod
```

### Check Ingress
```bash
kubectl get ingress -n n8n-prod
```

### Test Health
```bash
kubectl port-forward -n n8n-prod svc/n8n 5678:5678
curl http://localhost:5678/healthz
```

## Backup Status

- **Schedule**: Daily at 2 AM
- **Retention**: 30 days
- **Storage**: Azure Blob Storage (needs configuration)
- **Manual Test**: `kubectl create job --from=cronjob/n8n-backup n8n-backup-test -n n8n-prod`

## Troubleshooting

### If Pod is Not Ready
```bash
kubectl describe pod -n n8n-prod
kubectl logs -n n8n-prod deployment/n8n
```

### If PVC is Not Bound
```bash
kubectl describe pvc -n n8n-prod n8n-data
```

### If Ingress is Not Working
```bash
kubectl describe ingress -n n8n-prod n8n
```

## Security Notes

- The deployment uses non-root containers
- Network policies are in place with proper ingress rules
- RBAC with minimal permissions for both n8n and backup operations
- Secrets are properly configured
- TLS is enabled for external access
- Azure managed identity for secure backup operations
- Enhanced backup service account with appropriate permissions

## Performance Considerations

With the current resource limits, n8n may have limited performance for complex workflows. Consider:
- Monitoring resource usage
- Scaling up if needed (requires policy adjustments)
- Optimizing workflows for resource efficiency

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check the troubleshooting section
2. Review n8n documentation
3. Check Kubernetes logs and events
4. Verify Azure infrastructure configuration

## Additional Documentation

- **Monitoring Setup**: See `docs/MONITORING_SETUP.md` for comprehensive monitoring configuration
- **Disaster Recovery**: See `docs/DISASTER_RECOVERY.md` for recovery procedures and RTO/RPO
- **SQL Server Connectivity**: See `docs/SQL_SERVER_CONNECTIVITY.md` for VPN access configuration
